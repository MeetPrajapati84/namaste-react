## Dive Deep into useEffect()

### Defination: useEffect() will be `called after every render` of the component.

#### 1. if `no dependency` array => useEffect is called on after every render.

#### 2. if dependency array is `empty` = `[]` => useEffect is called on `initial render(just once)`.

#### 3. if dependency array is `[condition]` => useEffect is called `everytime ([condition]) is Updated`.
