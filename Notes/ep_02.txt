*********  npm install -D parcel ********

==> -D What is the -D?

==> There are Two types of dependencyes.
    1. Dev dependency  --> Generely Required for the developing the our app. --> Less Optimization on dev build. 
    2. Normal dependency --> It is Used in Production also. --> More Optimization on prod build.


******** npx parcel index.html **********

==> npm & npx:
    1. npm: To use 'INSTALL' our package like --> ("npm install -D parcel")
    2. npx: To use 'EXECUTE' our package like --> ("npx parcel index.html")
                                                  ("npx anyPackageName SourceOfOurProject") and execute the package of bundle.


***********************************

Parcel:

- Dev Build.
- Local Server --> (localhost:1234)
- HMR = Hot Module Replacement --> Which is automatically refresh our page when we can save. HMR improves the development experience by updating modules in the browser at runtime without needing a whole page refresh.
- File Watching Algorithm - Written in C++ --> Parcel doing that, Use.
- Caching --> Faster Builds.
- Diagnostics --> If you make an error in your code or configuration, Parcel displays beautiful         diagnostics in your terminal and in the browser.

==> Automatic production optimization.
- Image optimization
- Minification
- Tree shaking --> It statically analyzes the imports and exports of each module, and removes everything that isn't used.
- Compression
- Code splitting
- Content hashing --> Parcel automatically includes content hashes in the names of all output files. This enables long-term browser caching, because the output is guaranteed not to change unless the name does. (Ex: app.js, react.js ==> app.a96cdf.js)

- Bundling
- Differential bundling - support older browser
- HTTPs
- Different dev and prod bundles
