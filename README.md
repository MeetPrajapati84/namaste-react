- `useState` - Superpowerful State Variable in React
- `useEffect`

# 2 types of `Routing` in Web Apps

### 1) Client Side Routing

- In `React-Router (<Link to='/path'></Link>)` We are `not making` any network called while we are moving to our page `because all the Component are already to be loaded` to in our app.

### 2) Server Side Routing

- `Reload` the `Whole Page`.
- `(.html)` file page click on the `(<a href='/path'></a> Tag)` that makes a `network called` and `fetches data` of `(another.html)` file page that render the UI and `Refresh the whole page`.
